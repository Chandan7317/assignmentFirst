        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <p>JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web
            pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to
            look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video
            jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer
            cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in
            other parts of the Learning Area.</p>

            middleware and routing. It adds helpful utilities to Node.js HTTP objects and facilitates the rendering
            of dynamic HTTP objects.</p>
